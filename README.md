## 1. Initial Setup
This is the starting directory containing all initial scripts to execute initial setups and start several applications (e.g., spark, kafka, etc.).

## 2. Concepts and Prototypes
This directory contains small projects to illustrate the mechanics of different data science / data engineering concepts and prototypes. 

## 3. Conda Projects
This directory contains projects using conda environments. Note: Especially in a python context it is helpful to use conda environments to manage and control libraries for different projects. For instance in project A you may work with python 2.7 and Django 1.11, then in another project B you may work with python 3.6 and pyspark 2.4.0. As this example illustrates, sooner or later in different projects you will use a different stack of python version and libraries, therefore conda environments can make your life much easier when having to manage all this.
